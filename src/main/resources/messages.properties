  of sign language signs, where anyone can search for signs, browse, view, \
  download or integrate the content in any way they want.

help.search.text=The <a href="{0}">main page</a> can be used to search for any \
  kind of sign with free form search. For example you can <a href="{1}">search \
  for "bonjour"</a>. By default, the results are shown as an HTML page. The same \
  results can be retrieved as <a href="{2}">JSON</a> by adding the \
  <code>format=json</code> query parameter or as <a href="{3}">Atom / \
  OpenSearch</a> by adding the <code>format=atom</code> query parameter.
